        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>This page provides commentary some of the projects that I've worked on. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following projects are discussed below:

                <br><a href="#inventory">Inventory Manager</a>
                <br><a href="#pa-inspection">PA Inspection Stations</a>
                <br><a href="#this-site">This Site</a>
            
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="display-box" id="inventory">
        <h2>Inventory Manager</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/rororowyourkayak/inventory-manager" target="_blank">https://github.com/rororowyourkayak/inventory-manager</a></p>
        <p>In this project, I built a web-based inventory management system that allows users to store UPC-A based items.
            <br>The user stores a UPC-A code, category, description and quantity for each item they may store.
            <br> Additionally, this system allows for photo uploads to be viewed with an item's information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system features a user system and input validation based on Laravel.
             <br>The application supports importing and exporting of inventory as a CSV or XLSX file.
           <br>Project also features an example of recaptcha protection in the contact page.
    
        </p>
        
           <h4>Frontend</h4>
          <p> The frontend of this system was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and jQuery.
           <br> This project also made use of the DataTables and Select2 jQuery-based libraries.
          </p>
        
        
          <h4>Backend</h4>
           <p>The backend of this project was built using Laravel 8, PHP 8 and MySQL. 
            <br>This system is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, making database interactions important. 
             </p>

    <div class="display-box" id="pa-inspection">
        <h2>PA Auto Safety Inspection Stations</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/rororowyourkayak/pa_inspection_stations" target="_blank">https://github.com/rororowyourkayak/pa_inspection_stations</a></p>
        <p>This site is live. You can visit at: </p>
        <a href="https://pa-auto-inspections.com/" target="_blank">https://pa-auto-inspections.com/</a>
        <p> In this project, I built a site that displays information about the safety inspection stations in PA.
        <br>The purpose of this site is to make a more accessible medium for this information.
        <br>This site also features a convenient search tool for users to find stations.
        </p>

        <h4>Frontend</h4>
          <p> The frontend of this system was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5.
           <br> Additionally, the site's search tool was built with the help of Vue.js.
          </p>
        
        
          <h4>Backend</h4>
           <p>The backend of this project was built using Laravel 8, PHP 8 and MySQL. 
             </p>
             <p>
                The most important part of this site was extracting information into a database.
                <br>This was done by writing a script with Python using the openpyxl library.
                <br>After data was extracted, it was then turned into Laravel models using Laravel Excel.
             </p>

    <div class="display-box" id="this-site">
        <h2>This Site</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/rororowyourkayak/rororowyourkayak.github.io" target="_blank">https://github.com/rororowyourkayak/rororowyourkayak.github.io</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This site was built to be an about me and portfolio page. 
           <br> It features a playful theme and lots of great info about me. 
            <br>This site is hosted on GitHub pages, so it is only built on the front-end.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site just uses simple HTML and CSS. 
            <br>Everything here is custom raw CSS, no Bootstrap or other CSS libs. 
            <br> This project was a nice opportunity to practice framework-free coding.
            <br>Hope you enjoyed!
